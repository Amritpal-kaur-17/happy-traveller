			<h3 class="Places"><strong>City Beaches</strong></h3>

			<p class ="fLeft paragraph-content"><img class="fotos-by-pragraph" src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/landscapes/beach.png">If you enjoy sailing, water sports or just like to relax by the sea, Barcelona offers you all kinds of services and facilities so that you can enjoy your favourite activities while you admire the city's coastline and beaches. Barcelona’s beaches are designed to facilitate access for people with reduced mobility. Barcelona’s beachfront boardwalk stretches for miles. It will take a good hour to get from Barceloneta to Diagonal Mar on foot,but it’s a walk that really helps you understand the city. The westernmost beaches like Sant Sebastià are busier and more touristy.Barceloneta is the first of the Barcelona beaches and can therefore get quite busy during the summer months. Regardless of where you go though, the best times of day to hit up the beaches is in the morning. Although you'll probably spend time with the 'golden oldies', the water is calm and clean and the beach is relatively empty. There's also great water sports to explore including paddle boarding and surfing as well as sea-dooing and jazz cruises. </p>

			<h3 class="Places"><strong>Park Guell</strong></h3>


			<p class ="fLeft paragraph-content"> <img class="fotos-by-pragraph" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Parc_guell_-_panoramio.jpg/260px-Parc_guell_-_panoramio.jpg" > The ​​Park Guell is one of the most beautiful icons of the city. Park Guell is one of the masterpieces of the<span class="main-sentance"> Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi,</span> who projected it in 1900. Inaugurated as a public park in 1926, it was <span class="main-sentance">listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984, </span>reconizing its patrimonial and cultural value as a symbol of modern architecture. This playful urban park, the work of architect Antoni Gaudi, features peaceful greens, winding paths and many sculptures and mosaics designed by Gaudi himself. The park is full of trees and shrubs and as you walk around you'll see unusual and colourful sculptures, mosaics, walkways and tiling. You can also expect to see some fabulous views of Barcelona from Güell Park as the whole grounds are build on hill land. The park is one of the largest green spaces in Barcelona, ​​with more than 17 hectares, next to the Sierra de Collserola. Knowing that visitors have limited space for their well-being, it is important to book your Park Guell ticket in advance to avoid wasting time on the day of the visit or, more foolishly, losing the day. </p>


			<h3 class="Places"><strong>Gràcia</strong></h3>

			<p class ="fLeft paragraph-content"> <img class="fotos-by-pragraph" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Pla%C3%A7a_de_Trilla_-_Gr%C3%A0cia_-_Barcelona.JPG/220px-Pla%C3%A7a_de_Trilla_-_Gr%C3%A0cia_-_Barcelona.JPG" >Gracia was originally its own village set apart from the rest of the city. However, when the Eixample was built in the late 19th century, it served to connect old Barcelona and Gracia. Thus Gracia ceased to be a town and become a neighborhood in the larger metropolis that we now know and love as Barcelona. Gracia is immediately recognizable for its narrow streets, a stark contrast to the wide, modern boulevards of L’Eixample. It's known as a hip area with an active and politically-conscious community. Here you'll find a number of lively plazas, bars and restaurants, but modernismeit's a little more subdued other cultural hubs like the Born or El Raval, with a slightly more mature crowd. It’s a young, stylish and cosmopolitan area with students and artists, so there’s a multitude of bars, cafes and independent shops to be found. If you come to Gràcia during the Festa Major in August the area is transformed as the residents come together to decorate individual streets in imaginative ways to be the best in the neighbourhood</p>


			<h3 class="Places"><strong>Montjüic & Poble Sec, Barcelona</strong></h3>

			<p class ="fLeft paragraph-content"><img class="fotos-by-pragraph" src="https://www.whatbarcelona.com/img/images/city/montjuic-1.gif">Montjuic (“Jewish Mountain”) is a must-see area of Barcelona. With beautiful views of the city, 2 of the city’s best museums and a vast park, this hill is definitely worth the hike. Northwest Montjuic is also home to the <span class="main-sentance">“Poble Espanyol,” </span>a touristy, slightly cheesy but nonetheless attractive rendering of a “Spanish Village. Montjuic is a hill that overlooks Barcelona from the southwest. The low-lying area around Plaça de Espanya just below Montjuïc is Poble Sec. Poble Sec is easily accessible at the metro stops Espanya and Poble Sec. Getting to Montjuic is a little more complicated than arriving at other parts of the city. Due to its elevation, the metro does not run there. One option – by foot - is to use the series of escalators that run from the Palau Nacional at Plaça Espanya up the hill. A hike up to the top of Montjuic would take about an hour on a so-so trail.</p>

			<h3 class="Places"><strong>Tibidabo</strong></h3>

			<p class ="fLeft paragraph-content"><img class="fotos-by-pragraph" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Temple_del_Sagrat_Cor_vist_des_de_la_Talaia_del_Tibidabo.JPG/285px-Temple_del_Sagrat_Cor_vist_des_de_la_Talaia_del_Tibidabo.JPG">Tibidabo  is a hill overlooking Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. At <span class="main-sentance">512 metres (1,680 ft), it is the tallest hill</span> in the Serra de Collserola. Rising sharply to the north-west, it has views over the city and the surrounding coastline. The journey to Tibidabo amusement park starts with a short train ride from the centre of Barcelona. Once you alight from the train, you will take the Tramvia Blau which takes you halfway up the mountain. If you wish to go all the way to the top of Tibidabo, where the amusement park is situated, you will also need to catch a funicular train from the halfway point. Once at the top of the mountain you will be rewarded with magnificent views of Barcelona, an amusement park for the kids, and the opportunity to visit a beautiful church at the summit of the mountain. At the top station of Cablacarca which leads to the top of Tibidabo, is the Parque d'Atracccions. Attractions also include the vending machine museum Museu d'Automates del Tibidabo on the grounds of the amusement park. Temple of the Sacred Heart of Jesus sits on the summit of Mount Tibidabo. It is an impressive neogothic church crowned by a bronze statue of Jesus. Visitors can take an elevator to the top of the church to see a magnificent view of Barcelona.Torre de Collserola is a particular tower that was built for the 1992 Summer Olympics by Norman Foster. Standing 946 Ft (288 m) tall, it is the highest viewpoint in Barcelona. Its observation deck is located on the tenth floor and offers superb views over the city and the Mediterranean Sea.</p>


			<h3 class="Places"><strong>Sagrada Família</strong></h3>

The Basílica de la Sagrada Família Spanish also known as the Sagrada Família, is a large unfinished Roman Catholic minor basilica in the Eixample district of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.<span class="main-sentance"> Designed by Spanish/Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí (1852–1926), his work on the building is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</span> On 7 November 2010, Pope Benedict XVI consecrated the church and proclaimed it a minor basilica. the towers of the Sagrada Familia to enjoy unique views of the city. The most outstanding features inside the Sagrada Família are its impressive columns, built with materials of different hardness. Inside the Basilica are long, thick columns of red porphyry, volcanic rock, small and dark columns made from basalt and granite columns that project the exterior light. Every day tourists stand in line in front of its door to get in and see the interior of the church – paying a considerable fee for it. In the past years there has only been one day a year with free admission. The rumor is that the risk of suicide living close to Sagrada Familia is higher – probably because every day you see something that is never finished. Maybe that is just a rumor. If you’re thinking about coming to visit La Sagrada Familia anytime soon, don’t think twice. The three million visitors every year help support the project, which costs around 25 million euros annually. Thanks to your contributions when you visit (as well as those from donors), you can say that you’ve taken part in the construction of a masterpiece!</p>

			<h1 class="place-title"><strong>Amritsar, India</strong></h1>
			<div class="intro-of-place">
				<p class="author-desk"> From my pen ....... <br><br>It is the holiest place of worship for Sikhs, which revere the Golden Temple as it constantly reassures their faith in their religion and humanity. It is renowned for its mesmerising architecture, the patriotism, friendly volunteers, peaceful vibes and free community kitchen  and much-stop street food  destination. This is definitely one city you do not want to miss.</p>
				<p class="intro-of-place"> <img id="foto-of-city" src="https://github.com/Amritpal-kaur-17/myhtml/blob/main/golden%20temple.jpg?raw=true" >The meaning of the word ‘Amritsar’ translates to <span class="main-sentance">‘a pool of nectar.'</span> This beautiful, holy city lives up to its name in every way. Located in Punjab, the city is close to Pakistan geographically, with the Wagah Border situated 28 kilometers from the city. Amritsar  historically also known as Rāmdāspur and colloquially as Ambarsar, is a historic and the second most populous city in the Indian state of Punjab. The religious city in Punjab is famous for three things – the Golden Temple, delicious Amritsar food and the Wagah Border. Located in the state of Punjab, Amritsar has a mere 2.5 million people: a small city by Indian standards! The city centre feels open and modern but it only takes a few turns to feel totally off-grid in a maze of muddy, noisy alleyways. Before we explore the many things to do in Amristar, let’s touch upon the city’s rich history.<br><br> Over 500 years ago, <span class="main-sentance">the land Amristar is built upon was bought for 700 rupees.</span> Amritsar, a historic city of Punjab also known as <span class="main-sentance">Ramdaspur in the name of Guru Ram Das Ji,</span> 4th Guru of Sikhs has veiled many stories inside it in form of hidden architects in and around the walled city. Guru Amar Das, the fourth Sikh guru, constructed Amritsar around a man-made pool which was to become the Golden Temple. For many years, it was a wealthy city known for music, arts, performance and philosophy, perched at an optimum location for trade.When the British came to rule, Amritsar was drained of its rich assets. The city crumbled like many in India. Other events that have shaped Amritsar’s history include the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre where the British shot dead hundreds of innocent civilians, and Operation Blue Star, the standoff between the governments and militant Sikhs inside the Golden Temple. <br><br>If you are planning your visit to Amritsar, apart from the famous tourist destinations these hidden gems are must to be explored. As they say, ” “The gladdest moments is a departure into unknown places.” After a lot of exploring  we’ve come to the conclusion that this is definitely one city you do not want to miss. </p>

This dome is gilded with about<span class="main-sentance"> 100 kgs of pure gold,</span> hence the name ‘Golden Temple’.Open 24 hours a day, the massive golden palace rising out of a man-made lake is a truly impressive sight to behold and it’ll be tough to stop snapping photos from every angle. Take a dip in the holy Sarovar (holy pond) and explore the site, visited by millions of pilgrims and tourists from all over the world. The temple welcomes everyone, regardless of cast, creed, or race.<br><br> A weird and wonderful experience in Amritsar is dining at the world’s biggest community kitchen which feeds 100,000 people a day which is open <span class="main-sentance">24*7days and it provide free food.</span> This is known as a langar to Sikhs. I loved this experience because it was so unique: we sat cross-legged on the floor with a delicious dinner and hundreds of locals doing the exact same thing. You won’t pay a penny for this meal which I think is so amazing and hospitable. You’re presented with an empty tray and servers come around to dole out scoops of dahl, curd and chapatis.Food is available all day in the Golden Temple dining hall, so just arrive and make your way over there.<br><br>Visiting the Golden Temple is free.<span class="main-sentance"> Always cover your head (men & women) when entering the temple. </span>If you don’t have a scarf the temple will provide you with ones for free. There will be shoe counters to deposit your shoes, when you drop them off you will receive a token.<br><br>If you get the chance to visit the Golden Temple at night, I’d highly recommend it. While the daytime is better for photo opportunities, the evening is more atmospheric. Every night at 9.30pm, <span class="main-sentance">the Palki Sahib ceremony </span>sees the Sikh holy book, Guru Granth Sahib, get put to bed inside the temple. Temple guards carry it there while music plays and a crowd gathers, so it’s an interesting ceremony to see.</p>

My personal recommendation would be the Ramada Amritsar which is the closest luxury hotel in proximity to the Golden temple. You can even stay inside the Golden Temple for free in their Sarai accomodation which is open to tourists only. But I would say you wouldn’t have much chance of sleeping considering people will be in and out of this temple at all times of the night.The first major prayer time starting around 4am. For more information on this see here. I would highly recommend enquiring and booking in advance if this is your plan </p>
